    <h1>Why do we use the QWERTY Keyboard</h1>

    <p>Christopher Latham Sholes invented the "QWERTY" keyboard just before he died.</p>
    <p>Breanne's invention is a shoe insert that senses circulation and injury for the patient, and provides feedback through a vest and smartphone or watch. The patient feels vibrations ect through the vest to simulate what they would be feeling through their feet. This product is innovative because it solves a unique problem using technology in a creative way. It is also helping many people with a very real problem that didn't necessarily have a clear solution in the past. </p>
